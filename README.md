1. Primitive Types
a. Boolean

b. Number
Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
c. String

2. Composite Types
a. Array
Represents an ordered list of values.
b. Tuple
Represents an array with a fixed number of elements with different data types.
c. Object
Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
3. Special Types
a. Any
Represents a value of any type, allowing for dynamic behavior.
b. Void
Represents the absence of a value.
c. Never
Represents functions that never return or variables that are never assigned.
4. User-Defined Types
a. Enum
A way to organize and represent a set of named constants.
b. Union
Represents a value that can be one of several types.
c. Intersection
